Analysis for the ZTF Bright Transient Survey and RCF calculations

This repository contains the software necessary to recreate (some) of the figures and analysis presented in [The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey I: Spectroscopic Classification and the Redshift Completeness of Local Galaxy Catalogs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191012973F/abstract) by Fremling, Miller,  Sharma, Dugas, Perley, Taggart, Sollerman, Goobar, Graham, Neill, Nordin, Rigault, Walters, et al. (2020).

Data from the paper are stored in the [data/](https://github.com/adamamiller/bright_transient_survey/tree/master/data) directory, while the analysis and plotting routines are stored in the [figures/](https://github.com/adamamiller/bright_transient_survey/tree/master/figures).
